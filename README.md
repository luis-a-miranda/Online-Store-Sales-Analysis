# Online Store Revenue Analysis

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze and interpret the sales data of an online store to facilitate decision-making, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance overall business operations. Through SQL-based data exploration and cleaning, we aim to extract meaningful insights from the raw sales data. Additionally, by utilizing Power BI for data visualization, we aim to present the analysis in an interactive and visually appealing manner, enabling stakeholders to grasp the sales patterns and trends effortlessly.

## Key Features
This project offers the following key features and analyses:

1. Geographical Sales Distribution: Identify the locations that contribute the most to the total sales of the online store. By visualizing the sales data geographically, we can determine the regions with the highest sales weight and potentially uncover valuable patterns or opportunities.

2. Product Demand Analysis: Explore which products experience higher demand in the online store. By examining sales volumes, we can identify popular items, best-selling products, and potential areas for improvement or promotion.

3. Preferred Product Type: Determine the most desired type of product among customers. By categorizing products and analyzing sales within each category, we can identify customer preferences and tailor the store's offerings accordingly.

4. Sales Breakdown by Month and Category: Analyze the sales data on a monthly basis and break it down by product category. This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of sales trends over time, helping to identify seasonal patterns, category performance, and potential growth opportunities.
